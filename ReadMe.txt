All custom code for analysis of the data, as well as a sample dataset from one animal (with only the necessary information included). Run main.m to generate all the figures for this mouse. Also requires the circular statistics toolbox (2012a) to generate some of the figures. 

To run in MATLAB, set this folder to your root directory, add the Functions folder and subfolders to the path, and run main.m.

Originally ran in MATLAB version R2015a. Typically takes 3-10min to run, depending on the particular hardware. All figures will be written to the 'Plots' folder, and statistics will be output in the root directory. Population-level analyses will of course differ from the manuscript because it's just one mouse's data.
